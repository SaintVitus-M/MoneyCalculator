/**
 * The {@code SwapCurrenciesCommand} class implements the {@link Command} interface
 * and is responsible for swapping the selected currencies in the application's
 * user interface and then executing the exchange money command.
 *
 * <p>This command is typically used when the user selects the option to swap
 * the two currencies involved in a currency exchange. It updates the selected
 * currencies in both the {@link MoneyDialog} and {@link CurrencyDialog}, and then
 * triggers the "exchange money" command to perform the currency conversion calculation.
 *
 * <p>The command operates on the following components:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link SwingMainFrame}:</b> The main application window.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link MoneyDialog}:</b> Dialog that displays the money amount and allows the user to choose source currency.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link CurrencyDialog}:</b> Dialog that allows the user to choose the target currency for exchange.</li>
 * </ul>
