/**
 * The {@code ExchangeMoneyCommand} class implements the {@link Command} interface
 * and is responsible for performing currency exchange rate calculations and
 * displaying an animated histogram of exchange rates over a year.
 * This command is triggered when the "Calculate" button is pressed in the application.
 *
 * <p>The primary responsibilities of this class are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Calculating the exchange amount based on the selected currencies and input amount.</li>
 *   <li>Fetching historical exchange rate data for the past year.</li>
 *   <li>Displaying an animated histogram that visualizes the historical rates.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class relies on external APIs to fetch real-time and historical
 * exchange rates. The histogram is rendered using an integrated charting library.
