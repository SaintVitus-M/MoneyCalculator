/**
 * The {@code StatisticLoader} interface defines the contract for classes that are responsible for
 * loading exchange rate statistics between two currencies. It provides a method to retrieve
 * a time series of exchange rates for a given currency pair.
 *
 * <p>This interface is typically implemented by services or data providers that fetch
 * historical exchange rate data from external sources, such as financial APIs or databases.
 * The {@code loadStatistic} method allows for fetching exchange rate data for a specific period
 * (e.g., daily, monthly) between two currencies, represented by the {@link Currency} objects.
 *
 * <p>The returned {@link ExchangeRateTimeSeries} contains the exchange rates over time, which can
 * then be used for further processing, analysis, or visualization.
